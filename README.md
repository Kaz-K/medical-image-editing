## Synthetic images - Rectal cancer
![rectal_cancer_4](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image4.png)
> Axial T2-weighted MR image shows a tumor approximately 4 cm in size on the dorsal wall of the rectum. The deepest structure of the rectal wall was intact, indicating no infiltration beyond the muscularis propria.

![rectal_cancer_6](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image6.png)
> A semi-circumferential wall thickening is noted mainly on the dorsal wall of the rectum, with a deep depression at the center. Advanced colorectal cancer is suspected. The muscularis propria on the dorsal side has disappeared, reaching the rectal mesentery.

![rectal_cancer_9](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image9.png)
> A tumor of approximately 3.5 cm is predominant on the anterior wall of the rectum. It extends outside the wall anteriorly, with invasion into the seminal vesicles observed.

![rectal_cancer_10](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image10.png)
> A tumor of up to 5 cm is mainly seen on the dorsal wall of the rectum, accompanied by a central depression. The muscularis propria on the dorsal side has disappeared and reaches the rectal mesentery.

![rectal_cancer_11](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image11.png)
> A protruding lesion is observed predominantly on the anterior wall of the rectum. The deeper muscularis propria layer has disappeared, suggesting possible extramural invasion. Findings are concerning for advanced colorectal carcinoma.

![rectal_cancer_12](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image12.png)
> Wall thickening of approximately 4 cm is predominantly on the right side of the rectum, suggesting rectal cancer. In the deepest part, the muscularis propria has disappeared and reaches the rectal mesentery.

![rectal_cancer_15](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image15.png)
> There is approximately 2 cm of wall thickening on the left lateral wall of the rectum, suggesting rectal cancer. In the deepest part, the muscularis propria has disappeared with progression into the rectal mesentery noted.

![rectal_cancer_16](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image16.png)
> A tumor of approximately 3 cm predominantly on the left lateral wall of the rectum is observed, with a papillary structure protruding into the lumen. The muscularis propria in the deepest part has disappeared and reaches the rectal mesentery.

![rectal_cancer_19](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image19.png)
> A nodular structure of 2 cm protruding into the lumen from the posterior wall of the sigmoid colon is observed.

![rectal_cancer_20](/synthetic_images/rectal_cancer/image20.png)
> Wall thickening extending from the anterior wall to the left lateral wall of the rectum is observed, suggesting rectal cancer. The muscularis propria is intermittently disrupted, and progression into the rectal mesentery is observed.

## Synthetic images - Lung cancer

![lung_cancer_4](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image4.png)
> A 1.5 cm hypervascular nodular lesion is noted in the right lower lobe of the lung. Conditions such as pseudoaneurysm or tuberculous granuloma are suspected.

![lung_cancer_5](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image5.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodular lesion is observed in the right lower lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_6](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image6.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodular lesion is present in the peripheral region of the right middle lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_8](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image8.png)
> A 2 cm nodule is observed in the right middle lobe of the lung, raising suspicion for a malignant tumor.

![lung_cancer_9](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image9.png)
> A 2 cm nodule is observed in the right upper lobe of the lung, raising suspicion for a malignant tumor.

![lung_cancer_16](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image16.png)
> A large tumor is observed in the lingular segment of the left lung, suggesting suspicion for a malignant pulmonary tumor.

![lung_cancer_17](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image17.png)
> There is a 1.5 cm ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the left upper lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_19](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image19.png)
> A 1.5cm nodular lesion is identified in the apical segment of the right lung. Associated pleural indentation is noted.

![lung_cancer_20](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image20.png)
> Axial CT image showing a pulmonary nodule with a length of 2-3 cm and a cavity on the dorsal side of the right upper lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_21](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image21.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodule with a cavity is observed in the right lower lobe, with part of it protruding into the lumen.
