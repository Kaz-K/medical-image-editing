## Synthetic images - Lung cancer

![lung_cancer_4](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image4.png)
> A 1.5 cm hypervascular nodular lesion is noted in the right lower lobe of the lung. Conditions such as pseudoaneurysm or tuberculous granuloma are suspected.

![lung_cancer_5](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image5.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodular lesion is observed in the right lower lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_6](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image6.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodular lesion is present in the peripheral region of the right middle lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_8](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image8.png)
> A 2 cm nodule is observed in the right middle lobe of the lung, raising suspicion for a malignant tumor.

![lung_cancer_9](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image9.png)
> A 2 cm nodule is observed in the right upper lobe of the lung, raising suspicion for a malignant tumor.

![lung_cancer_16](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image16.png)
> A large tumor is observed in the lingular segment of the left lung, suggesting suspicion for a malignant pulmonary tumor.

![lung_cancer_17](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image17.png)
> There is a 1.5 cm ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the left upper lobe of the lung.

![lung_cancer_19](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image19.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodular lesion is observed in the apical portion of the right lung, accompanied by a pleural indentation.

![lung_cancer_20](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image20.png)
> A nodular lesion with a cavity measuring 2-3 cm in length is present in the dorsal region of the right upper lobe.

![lung_cancer_21](/synthetic_images/lung_cancer/image21.png)
> A 1.5 cm nodule with a cavity is observed in the right lower lobe, with part of it protruding into the lumen.
